## Introduction

Email spam remains a prevalent issue in the digital world, and efficient classification methods are necessary to filter out unwanted emails. This project presents a solution by employing machine learning algorithms to automatically classify emails as spam or legitimate.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ShreyashInsights/email-spam-classifier.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - You will need a dataset of emails labeled as spam or legitimate. Ensure that your dataset is properly labeled for training the model.

2. **Train the model:**
   - Use the provided scripts to preprocess your dataset and train the classification model. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

3. **Evaluate model performance:**
   - After training, evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Make predictions:**
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen emails. This will help classify incoming emails in real-time.
