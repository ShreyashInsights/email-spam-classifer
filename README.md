## Introduction

Email spamming is a widespread issue in the digital world. While the primary aim of this project is not to promote unethical practices, it serves as a demonstration of text generation capabilities and the potential risks associated with it. The generated spam emails are for educational and research purposes only.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/email-spam-nlp.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - You will need a dataset of legitimate emails to train the model. Ensure that you have a significant number of emails for better model performance.

2. **Train the model:**
   - Use the provided scripts to preprocess your dataset and train the NLP model.
